    <p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>

    <p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
