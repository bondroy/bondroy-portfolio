## Templating

### 11ty

This project uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) for templating and static generation. All templating takes place inside the `src` directory.

Refer to the [11ty docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) for more information on how to customize 11ty to your liking, it is an incredibly powerful tool!

### Assets

All static assets, like images and fonts, should be placed in `public`, as it is copied as-is into the `dist` directory.
